Q. Then why do we need to write functions in class car?
Because we want those functions must to be implemented by sub/child classes.
   We want to force the derived/child classes to implement or override these functions.{ If any class
Inherit from class car, it must override those two functions.}

To make it compulsory, write (=0) for those functions in parent class and need not write the functions
body, Which makes it Pure Virtual functions.

{a class with at least one pure virtual function is considered an abstract class. A pure virtual 
function is a function declared with the syntax:

virtual void functionName() = 0;

This = 0 syntax indicates that the function does not have an implementation in the base class. 
Since a class with a pure virtual function cannot be instantiated (because it has incomplete 
functionality), it's classified as an abstract class. Any subclass of this abstract class must 
provide an implementation for all pure virtual functions to be instantiated; otherwise, the subclass 
will also be considered abstract.}

i.e.
Assigning Virtual function to 0 makes it Pure Virtual function.
and those functions must be overriden by Derived classes, otherwise the derived classses will
become ABSTRACT while class car is actually ABSTRACT {as we can not create object of that class}

# When a class Inherit from abstract parent class, It also becomes Abstract, If its not overriding.
so, Child class must override.
And the purpose of pure virtual function is to achieve Polymorphism.

#same mechainism in Java is called as Dynamic Method Dispatch.
