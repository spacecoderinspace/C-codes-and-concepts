# Concrete function :- Concrete function means proper function with its body in or outside class.

we can create Three types of classes in c++

1). Base class with all Concrete functions. ----> Reusability

2). Base class with some Concrete and some Pure Virtual Function. ---> Reusability and Polymorphism
{its also abstract }

3). Base class with all pure virtual function. ----> Polymorphism
{such a parent class is called as Interface} 
its also abstract.
