There are 3 Ways of Inheritance :--

Case 1 :- 

class child : public parent
 
When Inheriting Publicly 
  a). protected becomes protected, and
  b). public becomes public in Child Class

Case 2 :-

class child : protected parent

When Inheriting protected
 a). protected becomes protected, and
 b). public also becomes protected in Child class

Public and Protected Members of Parent: These members become protected in Child. They are accessible within 
Child and any classes derived from Child, but they are not accessible to the outside world.

Private Members of Parent: These members remain inaccessible to Child (and any further derived classes)
because private members are only accessible within the class in which they are defined.

Case 3 :-

class child : private parent  {all becomes private}
 
Public and Protected Members of Parent: These members become private in Child. They are accessible 
within Child itself, but they cannot be accessed directly by any code outside Child, nor by any 
classes derived from Child.

Private Members of Parent: These members remain inaccessible to Child, as private members are only accessible 
within the class where they are defined.


============================================================
Another Situation

What if:-

class Parent { /*...*/ };
class Child : private Parent { /*...*/ };
class Grandchild : public Child { /*...*/ };

Here’s what happens with each level of inheritance and how it affects member accessibility,
 behavior, and typical use cases.

Access Modifiers and Inheritance in This Hierarchy
Child : private Parent:

This means that all public and protected members of Parent become private in Child.
Thus, Parent’s public and protected members are accessible within Child but are not visible to Grandchild or any other classes derived from Child.
For example, if Parent had a public method publicMethod(), it would be privately inherited by Child, 
meaning Child could use it internally, but Grandchild would have no access to publicMethod().
Grandchild : public Child:

Grandchild publicly inherits from Child, meaning it directly accesses the public members of Child.
However, because Child privately inherited from Parent, none of Parent’s members are accessible to Grandchild.
Effectively, Grandchild only has access to Child’s public and protected members (if any) and has no knowledge
of or access to Parent’s members.
