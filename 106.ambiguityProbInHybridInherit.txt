                             A fun()

                             D   Problem due to Multipath for fun()

Problem :- Class D is getting fun(), {Which is originally written in Class A} through Class B as well as
 class C.

 Solution:- Here we have ambiguity that fun() should be called via B or C.
              To remove this ambiguity, we have the concepts of VIRTUAL BASE CLASS 

Class A{

};
Class B: Virtual public A{     //B and C are now Vitual Base classes and will solve the problem of ambiguity.
                                      
};
Class C: Virtual public A{

};
Class D: public B, public C{


};
